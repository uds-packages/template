# UDS Package Template

UDS package template is a starting point for creating a new UDS package. It includes a basic structure for a UDS package and a set of tasks to help you get started.

After creating a repo from the UDS Package Template, follow [Making it your own](#make-it-your-own) documentation in order to customize the template for a new application package.

## Make it your own

1. Replace some common placeholders

| value                                 | replace_with                | example                                                |
| ------------------------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `#TEMPLATE_APPLICATION_NAME#`         | application name            | nginx, mattermost, cert-manager, etc...                |
| `#TEMPLATE_APPLICATION_DISPLAY_NAME#` | application name for humans | NGINX, Mattermost Cert Manager, etc...                 |
| `#TEMPLATE_CHART_REPO#`               | chart repository URL        | `https://charts.jetstack.io/`                          |
| `#UDS_PACKAGE_REPO#`                  | package repository URL      | `https://github.com/defenseunicorns/uds-package-nginx` |

2. Review, determine your need, and update

The following files will need to be customized for the application being packaged and include things like dependencies and application specific helm values. Examples have been included for reference.

## Tips

When you're ready to create your first release, here is an easy command to get release-please on the version you want (instead of modifying the files manually):

```bash
git commit --allow-empty -m "chore: release <upstream-app-version>-uds.<uds-sub-version>" -m "Release-As: <upstream-app-version>-uds.<uds-sub-version>"
```
